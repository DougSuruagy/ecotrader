# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the EcoTrader application.

## Structure

- `images/` - Contains all image files used in the application
- `icons/` - Contains icon files
- `fonts/` - Contains custom font files if needed

## Usage Guidelines

1. Keep images optimized for web (use WebP format when possible)
2. Use SVG for icons when possible for better scaling
3. Organize assets in appropriate subdirectories
4. Use meaningful file names that describe the content

When adding new assets, make sure they are properly optimized and follow the naming conventions established in the project.
